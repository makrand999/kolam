searched various reserach papers about the kolams.I got to know two ways ( acutally 3 but the third one is less usefull) first is from latice
and angle [link here] (https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.02144)
and the secode one in in the form of graph relations ( graph datastructure )
all the papers that i searched only focuses on kolam representation in algorithimic form or mathematical way 
came to conlclusion that we can convert a given kolam in the above one form and let computer draw it ( in litice and angle paper they have 
given a algorithum for it too) but our goal is not to just draw a kolam in computer way but to draw in in mathematical way 
what is mathematical way : so lets say we are given a kolam , now what we need to do is find all types of symetrics it has in it ( there is 
another type of property which is overlapping of knots i will talk about it down).after finding all the symetrics we will deduce the kolam is 
such a form that there will be no symetrics or any other property ( just a random or unit design )( its not truly randow because even small
desins around the dots follows some traditional rules).using this part of kolam which has no properties we are goiong to recreate the full 
kolam by just applying the symetrics that we removed sepuentially).this approch makes us able to show mathematical steps in creating a kolam 
( we can show it in animation/frames ) 

so our main goal comes to find different sysmetrics and other properties of kolam that can help us to recreate them 

after some observation there are various type of kolams( variation in there symetrics and basic rules ) so first of all we need to catagries 
all the kolams and list properties of each of them. 

also i found there are different ways to recreate a kolam one i liked in casae of multiple knots ( so in kolam there types on the basis of 
starting points if you start drawing form one point [ a curve ] and end it at same point where we started its called a knot a closed loop ) 
overlaping of knots is also in some form symetry/pattern we can start a speed based drawing of two knots who overlaps each other at different 
points ( so we need to determine the speed or start point of knots )

todays goal is to differentiate all kolams and there properties
