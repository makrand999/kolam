#Problem Statement Analysis
ID: 25107
Title: Develop computer programs to identify design principles behind Kolam designs and recreate them
Organization: AICTE
Department: Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)
Category: Software
Theme: Heritage & Culture
#Executive Summary
This project aims to preserve and digitize the ancient Indian art form of Kolams through computer  vision and algorithmic pattern recognition. We will develop a comprehensive
system that can analyze existing Kolam designs, extract their mathematical principles, and generate new authentic patterns.
# literature review 
# dataset creation 
Collect high-quality images of traditional Kolam patterns
Categorize by complexity, region, and occasion
Create ground truth annotations for key features
Minimum 500+ diverse patterns across categories
#core algorithm development 
-Raw Kolam Image → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Pattern Analysis → Rule Extraction
Key Components:

Preprocessing: Noise removal, contrast enhancement, binarization
Dot Detection: Grid point identification using computer vision
Line Tracing: Path following algorithms for continuous curves
Symmetry Analysis: Rotational and reflective symmetry detection

- Mathematical Modeling

Grid Theory: Dot matrix analysis and spacing patterns
Graph Theory: Representing Kolam as connected graphs
Fractal Analysis: Self-similarity in complex designs
Topology: Euler paths and closed curve analysis

- Pattern Recognition System

Feature Vectors: Encode design characteristics
Machine Learning: Classification of design types
Rule Extraction: Derive generative principles
